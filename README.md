# progrust-bar

A simple terminal progress bar in rust with a nice, type-driven API.

Early stages of development so it's basic and rough around the edges.

The API is subject to substantial change.

You almost certainly shouldn't use this (yet).

Code based on 
[Will Crichton's excellent talk, "Type-Driven API Design in Rust"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnnacleqg6k)
(although any errors are my own), with some inspiration from [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm).
