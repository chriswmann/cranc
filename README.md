# progrust-bar

A simple terminal progress bar in rust.

Early stages of development so it's basic and rough around the edges.

Code based on 
[Will Chricton's excellent talk, "Type-Driven API Design in Rust"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnnacleqg6k)
 with some inspiration from [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm).
