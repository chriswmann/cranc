# cranc ðŸ¦€

A simple terminal progress bar in rust with a nice, type-driven, functional API.

Early stages of development so it's basic and rough around the edges.

The API is subject to substantial change.

Code based on 
[Will Crichton's excellent talk, "Type-Driven API Design in Rust"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnnacleqg6k)
(although any errors are my own), with some inspiration from [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm).


## Why cranc?
A play on "cranc", which is Welsh for "crab" and "crank" as in "to crank the engine".
