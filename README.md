# progrust-bar

A simple terminal progress bar in rust.

Early stages of development so it's basic and rough around the edges.

The API is subject to change even with patch number changes.

You almost certainly shouldn't use this yet.

Code based on 
[Will Chrichton's excellent talk, "Type-Driven API Design in Rust"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnnacleqg6k)
(although any errors are my own), with some inspiration from [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm).
